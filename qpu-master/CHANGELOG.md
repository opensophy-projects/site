# Changelog
All notable changes to Motion GPU will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Renderer pipeline signatures now include `adapterOptions`, `deviceDescriptor`, and storage buffer `initialData` content, so declarative WebGPU configuration and initial buffer changes recreate the renderer/device instead of reusing stale GPU resources.
- `defineMaterial` now normalizes `Float32Array` `mat4x4f` defaults into immutable material snapshots while preserving `Float32Array` support for runtime `setUniform` updates.
- Fragment texture and fullscreen pass bind group layouts now resolve sampler/sample types from texture formats, using non-filtering sampling for float32 formats unless `float32-filterable` is available.

### Fixed
- Validate `writeStorageBuffer` offsets and data byte lengths against WebGPU 4-byte alignment requirements before enqueueing writes.
- Clear attempted storage buffer writes after flush/render failures so old writes are not replayed on later frames.
- Destroy the owned `GPUDevice` during renderer teardown and failed initialization, with idempotent renderer destruction.
- Destroy newly allocated runtime textures when upload or view creation fails, leaving the previous binding intact.
- Pass fresh error history snapshot arrays to callbacks and adapter state so consumer mutation cannot corrupt internal history.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-13
### Added
- Forward native canvas attributes from Svelte, React, and Vue `FragCanvas` adapters to the internal `<canvas>`, including `id`, `data-*`, `aria-*`, event handlers, `class`/`className`, and `style`.
- Expose the internal `FragCanvas` canvas consistently through `bind:canvas` in Svelte, the React 19 `ref` prop, and `canvas` / `getCanvas()` on the Vue component public instance.

### Changed
- Make `FragCanvas` canvas-facing across all framework adapters: DOM props passed to the component now target the internal `<canvas>`, while the wrapper remains a private layout, clipping, context, and error-UI implementation detail.
- Require React 19+ for the React adapter and use `ref` as a regular component prop instead of `forwardRef`.
- Ignore native canvas `width` and `height` attributes on `FragCanvas`; backing-store sizing remains controlled by measured CSS/container size and `dpr`.

### Removed
- Removed Vue-only `canvasClass` and `canvasStyle` props; use `class` and `style` directly on `FragCanvas` to target the internal canvas.

### Fixed
- Premultiply final canvas presentation output for WebGPU canvases configured with `alphaMode: 'premultiplied'`, while keeping material and render-pass shader contracts authored in straight alpha.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-12
### Added
- Added `PingPongShaderPass`, a pre-scene fragment-feedback pass for iterative fullscreen simulations using renderer-managed A/B render textures, previous-state sampling, configurable dimensions/format/filter/address modes, reset colors, includes, and defines.

### Changed
- Extended render-graph planning with pre-scene fragment-feedback steps alongside compute steps, while keeping post-scene render-pass slot routing unchanged.

### Fixed
- Reject `storage: true` textures as `PingPongShaderPass` targets with a deterministic configuration error instead of allowing a sampled-feedback pass to share a compute storage texture contract.
- Use a safe sampled fallback texture format for explicit float texture formats before runtime sources or feedback outputs are attached, avoiding transient `bytesPerRow` validation failures.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- Support typed `vec2f`, `vec3f`, and `vec4f` material defines, emitted as WGSL `const` vector declarations with validation and defensive cloning.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- Wake the renderer after asynchronous WebGPU `device.lost` and `uncapturederror` events so manual and on-demand render modes surface those failures without waiting for another user-driven frame.
- Back off renderer initialization and material-resolution retries with timers instead of scheduling continuous RAF frames while the same initialization failure is still active.
- Validate compute dispatch workgroup counts before command encoding so invalid or over-limit dispatch values fail with deterministic runtime errors instead of WebGPU validation cascades.
- Make multi-texture URL loading fail fast, abort sibling requests on the first failure, and dispose any textures that finished before the batch failed.
- Centralize texture abort-signal merging and fix the fallback path used without `AbortSignal.any` so already-aborted input signals are preserved.

### Performance
- Bound the renderer compute-pipeline cache with LRU eviction so live compute-shader edits cannot retain unbounded pipeline states for obsolete sources.
- Generate dynamic texture mipmaps with GPU render passes instead of CPU canvas downscaling, reducing per-update CPU work and external-image copies for `generateMipmaps` textures.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-16
### Fixed
- Rebuild the active renderer after WebGPU device loss so the runtime can recover instead of remaining stuck on a dead device.
- Flush queued storage-buffer writes while `autoRender` is disabled, preventing unbounded write accumulation while scheduler updates continue.
- Defer Svelte and Vue `useTexture()` loading until client mount so browser-only texture IO no longer starts during SSR setup.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- Added `FragCanvas` `color` pipeline options for Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapping, HDR/auto canvas presentation, `display-p3` canvas configuration, and explicit internal working formats.
- Added a private final presentation pass so tone mapping, HDR passthrough, and SDR encoding run after the base scene and all post-scene render passes.

### Changed
- Clarified the render graph contract: compute passes are planned as pre-scene dispatches, while render passes form the post-scene slot graph.
- Moved final output encoding into the `FragCanvas` `color` object as `color.outputEncoding`; the previous top-level `outputColorSpace` prop/type was removed.
- Renderer `source`/`target` and default named render targets now use the resolved working format. HDR/tone-mapped pipelines default that working format to `rgba16float`, while the standard SDR path remains on the preferred canvas format.

### Fixed
- Compute-only pass pipelines now render the base scene directly to `canvas` without allocating post-process ping-pong targets or running a final blit.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-24
### Changed
- Material signatures now include texture allocation and runtime-update configuration (`format`, `storage`, `update`, `width`, and `height`) so renderer state is rebuilt when texture contracts change.
- `TextureDefinition.fragmentVisible` now defaults to `false` for storage textures with `*uint`/`*sint` formats (previously `true`), matching the fragment shader contract that uses `texture_2d<f32>`. Explicitly setting `fragmentVisible: true` for an integer storage format now throws at material resolution with a descriptive error, replacing the generic WebGPU validation failure that surfaced during pipeline creation.
- Renderer now honours the explicit `TextureDefinition.format` value when allocating source-driven (non-storage) textures. Previously the format was always re-derived from `colorSpace` at runtime, silently downgrading user-declared formats like `rgba16float` to `rgba8unorm(-srgb)` and triggering a one-time extra reallocation on first upload.

### Fixed
- `storage: true` texture definitions now fail fast when they omit explicit `width`/`height` or define a `source`, matching the compute-managed storage-texture runtime contract.
- Fixed `PingPongComputePass.getCurrentOutput()` returning the wrong A/B buffer key after `setIterations(...)` was called between frames. Internal state now accumulates total iterations incrementally in `advanceFrame()` instead of multiplying frame count by the current iteration value, preserving correct read/write parity across iteration-count changes.
- Fixed `readStorageBuffer()` leaking the staging `GPUBuffer` when `mapAsync` rejected (e.g. on device loss). The staging buffer is now destroyed on both fulfilment and rejection paths.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-19
### Added
- Added renderer and compute E2E regression coverage for asynchronous compute-shader compilation diagnostics, asserting structured compute failures surface instead of falling back to generic uncaptured-error messaging.

### Fixed
- Updated compute-pipeline compilation reporting to await async shader compilation info and validation scopes, surfacing structured `COMPUTE_COMPILATION_FAILED` diagnostics instead of derivative `WebGPU uncaptured error` / `Invalid ComputePipeline` cascades.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-18
### Performance
- Replaced repeated dependency-queue `sort()` calls and `shift()` in `frame-registry` topological scheduling with sorted insertion plus a head index, reducing scheduler rebuild overhead during task/stage graph recomputation.
- Reused the internal `resourceRefs` backing array in the compute storage bind-group cache, replacing per-miss spread copies with indexed writes to reduce allocation churn when bound compute resources change.
- Nulled out stale slots in the compute storage bind-group cache backing array after a resource-ref count shrink, topology change, or `reset()` call, preventing long-lived GPU object references from blocking GC in those code paths.
- Removed the intermediate `map()` allocation when rebuilding `activeKeys` in renderer render-target sync, constructing the `Set` in a single pass during render-target signature changes.
- Replaced three `split('\\n')` line-count scans in `buildShaderSourceWithMap` with allocation-free newline counting, reducing transient string-array creation during shader compilation.

### Fixed
- Refined the Svelte, React, and Vue error-overlay source snippet styling with a larger alert-message radius, rounded active-tab top corners, and a separated snippet top border treatment.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-18
### Performance
- Added `packUniformsIntoFast` — a validation-free uniform packing path for the renderer hot loop that skips per-entry type checks (already enforced at `setUniform` call time), reducing per-frame CPU overhead by ~3× compared to the public `packUniformsInto` path.
- Added `Float32Array.set()` fast path inside `writeUniformValueFast` for `mat4x4f` uniforms backed by `Float32Array`, replacing a 16-element manual loop with a single native typed-array copy.
- Returned a shared `EMPTY_DIRTY_RANGES` sentinel from `findDirtyFloatRanges` when no dirty ranges are detected, eliminating a heap allocation on every clean frame in the renderer upload path.
- Pre-allocated `canvasSurface` and `frameSlots` objects in the renderer and mutated them in place each frame, removing per-frame `{ texture, view, width, height }` allocations in the render path.
- Merged two consecutive `.map()` iterations over `uniformLayout.entries` in `syncMaterialRuntimeState` into a single `for` loop, halving traversal work on material signature changes.
- Integrated `ResizeObserver` into the runtime loop canvas sizing path; canvas dimensions are now read from a cached observer callback instead of calling `getBoundingClientRect()` (a forced layout reflow) on every animation frame.
- Moved `assertDefinedMaterial` call in `resolveMaterial` to after the WeakMap cache check, so `Object.isFrozen` and field-presence guards are skipped entirely on cache hits (every steady-state per-frame call).
- Replaced `profilingHistory.shift()` (O(n)) with an O(1) ring buffer in `frame-registry`; a head-pointer advance overwrites the oldest slot without shifting any elements, with no allocation per push.
- Pre-allocated a closure-level `clampedFrameState` object in `frame-registry` that is mutated in place when `maxDelta` clamps the delta, removing the `{ ...state, delta }` spread allocation per clamped frame.
- Added non-function fast-path in `resolveInvalidationToken` — static string/symbol tokens return immediately without entering the function-resolver branch, called N-tasks × 60 fps.
- Pre-computed `frameKeyToString(key)` as `keyString` on `InternalTask` at registration time, eliminating `Symbol.prototype.toString()` calls inside the per-frame profiling loop.

### Added
- Added `packUniformsIntoFast` as an internal-use export for the renderer, with JSDoc marking it `@internal`.
- Added benchmark cases for `packUniformsIntoFast`, `mat4x4f` Float32Array packing, and the clean-frame dirty-ranges path to `scripts/perf/core-benchmark.ts`.
- Added unit tests for `mat4x4f` `Float32Array` uniform packing (identity matrix, arbitrary values, non-zero layout offsets).
- Added integration tests for `ResizeObserver` lifecycle (observe/disconnect), dimension propagation, and `getBoundingClientRect` fallback behavior in the runtime loop.
- Added ring buffer correctness tests covering window saturation, shrink/grow semantics, and `frameCount` invariants.
- Added `frameState` pre-allocation tests verifying object identity across clamped and non-clamped frames.
- Added profiling key stability test for Symbol-keyed tasks.

### Fixed
- Improved uncaptured WebGPU error reporting to preserve and prioritize root-cause validation messages (for example dispatch-limit and binding-limit failures) instead of surfacing only derivative `Invalid CommandBuffer` follow-up errors.
- Added targeted uncaptured-error classifications and hints for compute dispatch workgroup-limit violations and storage-buffer binding-size violations, with renderer + error-report tests covering the new behavior.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-11
### Added
- Added first-class Vue adapter support with dedicated `@motion-core/motion-gpu/vue` and `@motion-core/motion-gpu/vue/advanced` entrypoints.
- Added Vue adapter runtime surface parity (`FragCanvas`, `MotionGPUErrorOverlay`, `Portal`, `useMotionGPU`, `useFrame`, `usePointer`, `useTexture`, and user-context helpers).
- Added comprehensive Vue adapter test coverage, including runtime behavior, hooks, context, portal rendering, and adapter API parity.
- Added a full Vue E2E harness with scenario parity for runtime, uniforms, textures, passes, mixed passes, lifecycle, perf, and shader recovery checks.
- Added Vue declaration emit step (`emit-vue-dts.mjs`) and Vue TS config support for package type generation and validation.

### Changed
- Updated package metadata to include Vue exports (`./vue`, `./vue/advanced`), Vue peer dependency declarations, and Vue-oriented dev tooling dependencies.
- Updated package checks to run `vue-tsc` and added a dedicated `e2e:serve:vue` workflow for framework-scoped E2E runs.
- Updated package build pipeline to process `.vue` entrypoints and include Vue plugin integration in package builds.

### Fixed
- Added Vue module shims to stabilize package-level Vue type-check workflows.
- Stabilized Vue adapter canvas layout behavior and ensured adapter CSS is injected in Vue entry output bundles.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-07
### Added
- Added new framework-agnostic pointer helpers in `core/pointer`, including pointer kind normalization, coordinate conversion (`px`, `uv`, `ndc`), and frame-request mode resolution.
- Added `usePointer` in both Svelte and React adapters with unified mouse/touch/pen support, click synthesis, `lastClick` state, and explicit `resetClick()` handling.
- Added dedicated pointer-focused tests for core helpers and both adapter hooks (`pointer.test.ts`, `use-pointer.test.ts`, `react-use-pointer.test.tsx`) plus Svelte fixture coverage for outside-canvas press tracking.
- Added extended `usePointer` option/callback coverage (`clickButtons`, `clickEnabled`, `trackWhilePressedOutsideCanvas`, callbacks, `pointercancel`, multi-pointer filtering) in both Svelte and React hook tests.

### Changed
- Updated playground demos (`diamond`, `fresnel-rubiks`, `particle-icosahedron`) to use `usePointer` instead of manual pointer event listener boilerplate.
- Expanded docs and package guidance to cover pointer-hook workflows in API reference, hooks/context guides, scheduler examples, and package README/SKILL docs.
- Normalized docs code examples by removing unnecessary escaped closing `script` tags in snippet templates to satisfy eslint `no-useless-escape`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-06
### Performance
- Replaced `Reflect.deleteProperty` with the `delete` operator in `resetRuntimeMaps` and `resetRenderPayloadMaps` to reduce reflective API overhead when cleaning up stale uniform and texture keys after a material signature change.
- Eliminated heap allocations in `setError` and `syncErrorHistory` by replacing spread-copy (`[...errorHistory, report]` / `.slice()`) with in-place `push` and `splice`, reducing GC pressure when error history is active.
- Eliminated the conditional spread object and `splice(0)` copy in the per-frame storage-write flush path; the pending-writes array is now passed by reference and cleared in-place with `length = 0` after the synchronous `render()` call.
### Added
- Added structured compute-stage shader diagnostics metadata (`shaderStage`, `computeSource`, compute-line source mapping) in the error diagnostics payload.
- Added compute-source snippet support in normalized error reports for compute shader compilation failures.
- Added dedicated compute diagnostics tests (`compute-diagnostics.test.ts`) including measurable classification/completeness assertions.
- Added compute storage bind-group cache unit tests (`compute-bindgroup-cache.test.ts`) and renderer integration assertions for stable-frame allocation behavior.
- Added runtime benchmark metric `compute_storage_bindgroup_creations_per_1000_frames` to track compute storage bind-group allocation pressure.
- Added `texture-fragment-visibility.test.ts` coverage for `fragmentVisible` defaults and signature invalidation behavior.

### Changed
- Updated compute shader codegen with mapped variants (`buildComputeShaderSourceWithMap`, `buildPingPongComputeShaderSourceWithMap`) to preserve generated→source line metadata.
- Updated renderer compute pipeline error handling to wrap compute pipeline creation failures as structured diagnostics with runtime context.
- Expanded compute-focused test coverage across compute shader generation and renderer integration paths.
- Updated renderer compute dispatch path to cache storage buffer/storage texture bind-group layouts and bind groups, invalidating only when topology or bound resources change.
- Updated ping-pong compute binding flow to reuse prebuilt A→B / B→A bind groups instead of creating a new bind group every iteration.
- Updated fragment-stage texture binding pipeline to respect `fragmentVisible:false`, excluding compute-only texture slots from fragment WGSL declarations and group(0) bind-group layouts.
- Updated texture normalization defaults to include `fragmentVisible: true` and made material signatures include `fragmentVisible` so renderer rebuild invalidation remains deterministic.

### Fixed
- Improved compute-stage error normalization so diagnostics-backed compute failures consistently map to `COMPUTE_COMPILATION_FAILED`.
- Stabilized runtime error-overlay behavior by delaying error clear until a short success window passes, preventing show/hide flicker during intermittent failures (including `WEBGPU_UNCAPTURED_ERROR` from compute workflows).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-30
### Added
- Added first-class compute support with new `ComputePass` and `PingPongComputePass` exports in root, core, Svelte, and React entrypoints.
- Added `storageBuffers` material definitions with runtime validation (`size`, `type`, `access`, `initialData`) and immutable material snapshots.
- Added storage-focused texture options for compute workflows (`storage`, `format`, `width`, `height`, `fragmentVisible`).
- Added `FrameState.writeStorageBuffer(...)` and `FrameState.readStorageBuffer(...)` APIs for runtime CPU↔GPU storage-buffer workflows.
- Added compute-shader contract/codegen utilities with strict `@compute @workgroup_size(...) fn compute(...)` validation and workgroup-size extraction.
- Added broad compute/storage test coverage, including pass behavior, shader generation, storage runtime read/write, renderer integration, and public API snapshots.
- Added expanded runtime error classification coverage with dedicated codes for material preprocessing, compute-contract violations, runtime resource binding failures, storage read/write bounds failures, render-graph validation failures, ping-pong configuration failures, and invalid uniform payloads.

### Changed
- Updated pass plumbing from render-only arrays to mixed `AnyPass[]`, allowing post-scene render passes and pre-scene compute passes to coexist in one `passes` array.
- Updated renderer internals to allocate/manage storage buffers and storage textures, cache compute pipelines, and flush pending storage writes during frame submission.
- Updated material resolution/signature inputs to include storage buffer definitions and storage texture bindings, triggering deterministic rebuilds when those contracts change.
- Updated benchmark/runtime frame-state mocks to include the new storage-buffer APIs.
- Updated runtime-context presentation to structured multi-line formatting with pretty-printed `materialSignature` JSON and list-based `passGraph`/target sections.

### Fixed
- Added explicit compute compilation error normalization with `COMPUTE_COMPILATION_FAILED` classification and recovery metadata.
- Fixed early compute-only pass plans to resolve a valid final output path for canvas presentation.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-22
### Changed

- Matched the React `MotionGPUErrorOverlay` structure and styling 1:1 with the Svelte overlay implementation.
- Fixed missing WebGPU type globals in published declarations by patching `dist/*.d.ts` with `@webgpu/types` references and keeping `d.ts.map` line mappings aligned after the header injection.

- Added a configurable threshold for dirty-range merge behavior.

### Documentation
- Aligned error-reporting docs with the latest runtime API.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-14
